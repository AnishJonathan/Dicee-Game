# Dicee-Game
I have created a Dice Game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In my dice game, the outcome is automatically displayed when the page is refreshed. Both Player 1 and Player 2 roll their dice, with values generated using Math.random(). The game compares the rolls and displays the winner. No button click is required; the outcome is decided instantly upon refresh. Key concepts used include Math.random(), DOM manipulation, and dynamic content updates.
